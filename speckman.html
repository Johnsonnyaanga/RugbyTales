        <h1 style="text-align: center;">The story of Rosko Speckman</h1>
        <p>Born on 28th April 1989 Roscko Shane Speckman is every deffender's worst nightmare, with unimaginable agility he can side step anyone even half a meter close, combine that with ruthless speed you have one the best players in the 7s world and a super rugby legend</p>
        <p>But would you believe me if i told you the speed aspect was'nt always his best quality</p>
        <p>Starting out speckman played as scrum-half and as years rolled by,  his coach started noticeing his rugby talent and placed him in the outside center position</p>
        <p>He wanted to play rugby with speed but recalls that he was'nt fast enough and went to ask advice from his father.</p>
        <p>"Well we have to go old school", said his father. Speckman had to drag a tire sprinting up a steady hill for a whole year</p>
        <p>He says for a year he did the drill in rain and on the hot sun determined to hit the field with pure electricty as his friends played touch and cricket, look at him today</p>
        <p>He has played for the south african 7s team blitzborg, the sharks and blues in the super rugby and many other clubs.He was also nomited as one of the best players in the Hsbc 7s series at one point</p>
